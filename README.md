## Quick Start

All of the models and databases are already built from the beginning and you can just use the one that comes in this github.
However, there are [custom commands](#usage) that you can use to get data and train the classifier.

To build and run the website:

```bash
$ cd articleclassifier
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Then access [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser.

## Usage

### Commands:

- Get training data:

```bash
$ python manage.py get_data
```

- Train the model:

Used to train the classifier.

```bash
$ python manage.py train_model
```

- Print out confusion matrix:

```bash
$ python manage.py print_confusion_matrix
```

**This command also outputs accuracy in the cli.**

- Delete the database and model file (useful when you want to remove every data related files):

```bash
$ python manage.py delete_data
```
